/**
 * URL synchronisation for the abilities screen.
 *
 * Replaces useUrlViewSync + useLibraryTabSync, which Feature 102 merged for a concrete reason:
 * both wrote history with `pushState( build( …, window.location.href ) )`. Run in the same tick —
 * opening an ability while a toolset is selected, say — each read a stale `href` and the second
 * clobbered the first, so one of the two query args silently vanished. One hook, one pushState.
 *
 * `?tab=` deliberately survives `?action=edit`, so Back from the edit form returns to the toolset
 * the operator was on rather than dumping them in "All".
 *
 * parseTabFromUrl() and buildUrlFromTab() are salvaged verbatim from useLibraryTabSync so their
 * existing unit tests keep testing the same functions — including the SEC-052-I-003 sentinel
 * contract, which must not regress: an unrecognised `?tab=` value falls back to ALL_TABS_KEY and
 * is never passed downstream raw.
 *
 * @since 0.2.0
