/**
 * Feature 099 — screen 5: connect a transport.
 *
 * The screen the whole wizard exists for. Abilities do nothing until something
 * exposes them to an AI client, and this is where that connection is made.
 *
 * Three states, all reachable:
 *
 * - Recommended transport missing → install it in place, then hand off to its
 *   own setup.
 * - Recommended transport already active → say so and offer to finish, rather
 *   than offering to install something that is already there (FR-025).
 * - Alternative transport chosen → Continue leads to its instructions, or
 *   straight to the enablement walkthrough when it is already present.
