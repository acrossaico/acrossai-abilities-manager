/**
 * Feature 099 — Selectable card component (server picker rows + Step 5 method cards).
 *
 * Renders as a `<label>` wrapping a hidden native `<input type="radio">` so
 * keyboard nav (Tab + arrow keys) works out of the box. `aria-checked`
 * announces state to screen readers.
 *
 * Contract shape from `contracts/wizard-state.md`:
 *   <RadioCard selected={bool} onSelect={fn} title=".." subtitle=".." badge={element?}>
 *     {children}
 *   </RadioCard>
 *
 * SECURITY: `title` + `subtitle` render as text nodes (React auto-escapes).
 * `badge` + `children` render as-is; the caller is responsible for passing
 * only safe React elements (no dangerouslySetInnerHTML anywhere in-tree
 * per TASK-SEC-004).
 *
 * @package

			   Feature 099 diverges from the sibling here, deliberately.
			   The sibling puts role="radio" + aria-checked + tabIndex on the
			   <label> and makes the real input unfocusable. That trips two
			   jsx-a11y rules (a <label> is non-interactive, so it may not take
			   an interactive role, and once it has one it stops being a label)
			   and — more importantly — it hand-rolls keyboard behaviour that
			   the platform already provides.

			   Instead the native input stays focusable and merely visually
			   hidden, so arrow-key navigation within the group, checked state,
			   and screen-reader announcement all come from the platform. The
			   card is styled via :focus-within so the focus ring still appears
			   on the card itself. Rendered appearance is unchanged (SC-005).
