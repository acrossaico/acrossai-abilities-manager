		// same page's `contents()` dispatcher when `?quick-connect=1` is present,
		// so registering a second page would create a duplicate capability
		// surface for one onboarding flow.
		//
		// The sidebar label is "Connect" — just the verb. Every other surface says
		// "Quick Connect via AcrossAI"; sitting under the AcrossAI parent, directly
		// below its own name, both the "Quick" and the "via AcrossAI" are saying
		// something the position already says. The page title keeps the full
		// "Quick Connect" so the wizard is still named that wherever it is
		// referred to from outside the menu.
		//
		// Skipped entirely on sites running AcrossAI MCP Manager: it registers its
		// own "Quick Connect" under this same parent, and one sidebar does not
		// need two onboarding wizards.
		//
		// No position is requested here. Several plugins register into this shared
		// parent at overlapping positions and WordPress's collision handling then
		// shuffles items away from their declared slots, so the final placement is
