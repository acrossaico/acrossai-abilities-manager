 * Registers the WP ability category used by every ability under includes/Abilities/ContactForm7/.

 * Runs on wp_abilities_api_categories_init — before the Library Processor calls
 * wp_register_ability() at wp_abilities_api_init P5. WP core silently drops any ability whose
 * category was not pre-registered (BUG-WP-CORE-ABILITY-CATEGORY-PRE-REGISTRATION), so this must not
 * be reordered relative to the Processor.
 *
 * The presence probe goes through Contact_Form_7_Guard so every CF7 symbol in the suite is named in
 * exactly one directory — the same rule Test_Contact_Form_7_Architecture enforces for the abilities.
