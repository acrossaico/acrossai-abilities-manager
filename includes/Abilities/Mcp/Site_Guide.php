/**
 * The site guide, for a client connected to an MCP server this plugin does not own.
 *
 * {@see \AcrossAI_Abilities_Manager\Includes\Abilities\Toolset\Guide} written for a different
 * reader. The first-party guide addresses a client holding every dispatcher and explains how to
 * choose between them. This one addresses a client holding a host's own tools plus one gateway, and
 * its job is to say that the gateway exists and what is behind it.
 *
 * Host-neutral, and there is one of these rather than one per host — see {@see Site_Toolset} for
 * why. It was `toolset/elementor-site-guide` until 0.0.43, in development only.
 *
 * The four sections — the calling convention, what this site holds, the unusual Toolsets, the error
 * codes — are inherited rather than restated, so the two guides cannot drift about how a Toolset is
 * called. Only the slug, label, description and routing differ.
