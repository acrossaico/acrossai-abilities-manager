/**
 * One gateway to the whole site, for a client connected to an MCP server this plugin does not own.
 *
 * Every other Toolset covers one area. This one covers all of them, because of where it is used. A
 * client on somebody else's server already has their tools, and contributing fifteen dispatchers
 * beside them would bury what they shipped. So the areas become a menu this tool returns rather
 * than entries in the client's tool list.
 *
 * **Deliberately host-neutral, and there is exactly one of these.** It was
 * `toolset/elementor-site` until 0.0.43, when a second host made the naming a lie. Nothing about
 * dispatch was ever Elementor-specific — `groups()` spans every group on the site — so a per-host
 * copy would have duplicated the whole class to change a slug and three sentences. One ability slug
 * can be contributed to any number of servers: each host's filter appends it and the adapter builds
 * that server's tool list from slugs, so a new host is one
 * {@see Host_Mcp_Server} subclass and no new Toolset.
 *
 * Host-specific wording therefore lives in `Host_Mcp_Server::instructions()`, which is read at
 * `initialize` and is per host. That is the right split: this description says what the tool
 * reaches, the connect message says how it relates to the tools it is sitting among.
 *
 * The shape is `toolset/integrations`' — answer a bare `discover` with the map, not the contents —
 * applied to every group instead of the plugin ones. Measured on a 447-ability site: the menu is
 * ~751 tokens for thirteen rows against ~6,752 to list the same catalogue flat, and it is what lets
 * a model route to `database` or `files` instead of guessing.
