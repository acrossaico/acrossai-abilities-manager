/**
 * Feature 104 — read-only reporting over LiteSpeed's database optimiser.
 *
 * **Read-only by necessity, not by preference.** LiteSpeed exposes no entry point for running a
 * cleanup that is usable from an ability: `DB_Optm::handler()` takes its type from `$_GET` via
 * `Router::verify_type()` and ends in `Admin::redirect()`, which exits; `handler_clean_db_cli()`
 * returns false unless `WP_CLI` is defined; `_db_clean()` is private, and the class fires no action
 * or filter anywhere. Defining `WP_CLI`, reflecting into a private method, or reimplementing the SQL
 * were all rejected — the first changes behaviour for every plugin in the request, the second breaks
 * on any LiteSpeed release, and the third abandons the rule that the host's database belongs to the
 * host.
 *
 * The counting API is public, so "show me what a cleanup would remove" works, and that is the half
 * that informs a decision. Actually running one stays in wp-admin.

	/**
	 * Which ability can actually perform each cleanup, since LiteSpeed's own cannot be called.
	 *
	 * Every entry names an ability this plugin already ships. `safe` distinguishes the two shapes:
	 *
	 * - **true** — a purpose-built ability that goes through WordPress's own APIs, so deleting a
	 *   comment also removes its meta, and deleting a transient also removes its timeout row.
	 * - **false** — only `database/delete-db-rows` fits, and that is a raw `$wpdb->delete()`.
	 *   Deleting rows from `posts` directly leaves their `postmeta` behind, which is precisely why
	 *   LiteSpeed itself carries a separate `orphaned_post_meta` type: its cleanup is a two-pass
	 *   operation. A caller taking this route must run the orphan pass afterwards or the database
	 *   ends up larger than before, not smaller.
	 *
	 * Keys must stay in step with types(); Test_LiteSpeed_Suite_Contract asserts they do, so a future
	 * LiteSpeed release adding a cleanup type cannot leave a silent hole here.
