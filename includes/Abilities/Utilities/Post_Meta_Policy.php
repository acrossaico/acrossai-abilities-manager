/**
 * Which caller-supplied post-meta keys a generic post writer may set, and why it refused the rest.
 *
 * `content/update-post` is the "safe editor": a bulk field update where an agent may sweep in meta
 * it did not mean to touch. Feature 065 (FR-009) therefore had it strip protected meta. That strip
 * was two rules OR-ed together, and the second was too broad:
 *
 *   1. `_`-prefixed keys — WordPress's convention for internal meta (`_edit_lock`, `_wp_*`,
 *      serialized builder state). Writing these through a bulk update is a genuine footgun.
 *   2. `is_protected_meta()` — but that function guards the custom-fields UI and the REST meta
 *      endpoint, NOT programmatic `update_post_meta()`. A plugin marks its keys protected only to
 *      hide them from that box; the keys are ordinary writable data. Rank Math registers
 *      `rank_math_title`, `rank_math_description` and friends this way.
 *
 * So rule 2 dropped legitimate SEO meta that `content/create-post` and the dedicated
 * `content/update-post-meta` both write happily — `update-post-meta`'s own description is "Works
 * for ANY meta key, including protected keys." The result (#274): a create-then-refine workflow
 * saved its Rank Math meta on create and silently lost it on update, while the response reported
 * success. This keeps rule 1, drops rule 2.
 *
 * The `acrossai_allowed_protected_meta` filter still lets an operator opt a `_`-prefixed key back
 * in, exactly as FR-009 intended, and the same filter still governs what `content/get-post`
 * returns on the read side.
 *
 * Only `content/update-post` routes through this. `content/create-post` is left permissive on
 * purpose: it is the initial-write path and already writes `_`-prefixed keys such as
 * `_thumbnail_id` (the featured image), so applying this guard there would trade one data-loss bug
 * for another. `content/update-post-meta` is the escape hatch for writing a `_`-prefixed key
 * through an editor flow.
