 * **Nothing here reimplements a write.** Each post goes through
 * `PostSeoService::updateSeoData()` — the same public service AIOSEO's own
 * `aioseo-posts/seo-data-update` calls. That matters for two reasons beyond not duplicating code:
 *
 * 1. It keeps AIOSEO's per-post `current_user_can( 'edit_post', $id )` check in the loop. A bulk
 *    editor that mapped fields itself and called `Models\Post::savePost()` directly would drop that
 *    check and hand any caller past the floor a write to every post on the site.
 * 2. `savePost()` is patch-aware, and the service is what decides which keys that means. A field the
 *    caller did not name keeps its value; a title equal to the post type's template is cleared so the
 *    post goes back to inheriting rather than storing a duplicate.
 *
 * Per-post outcomes are reported individually and a failure never aborts the run: a bulk edit that
 * stopped on the third of twenty posts, having written two, would leave the caller with no way to
 * know where it got to.

	/**
	 * Validate the `robots` sub-keys and reconcile AIOSEO's per-post "use default" switch.
	 *
	 * **The trap this exists for.** A post's robots directives are only read when its
	 * `robots_default` flag is OFF — `Meta\Robots.php:211` returns the global post-type values and
	 * never looks at the per-post columns otherwise. AIOSEO's service maps `use_default` but never
	 * clears it, so `robots: { noindex: true }` stores `robots_noindex = true` beside
	 * `robots_default = true`, reports success, and the page goes on emitting the post type's
	 * defaults. Verified on AIOSEO 5.0.3: both columns true after such a write.
	 *
	 * AIOSEO's own `aioseo-posts/seo-data-update` has the same hole. Easy MCP AI's AIOSEO tool works
	 * around it by forcing the flag off silently; this does the same thing and SAYS SO in `notes`,
	 * because a write that quietly did more than it was asked is the harder thing to debug later.
	 *
	 * A caller who passes `use_default: true` alongside flags has asked for the defaults explicitly.
	 * That is honoured, with a note that the flags will not take effect — overriding an explicit
	 * instruction would be worse than reporting the contradiction.
