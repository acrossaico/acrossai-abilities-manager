/**
 * A Toolset dispatcher built from an integration's declaration.
 *
 * The thirteen sibling classes each hardcode four answers, which is right for the curated first-party
 * groups: they are few and they rarely change. Integrations are neither. Every one of them would carry
 * the same four declarations it has already made through
 * {@see \AcrossAI_Abilities_Manager\Includes\Abilities\Integrations\AcrossAI_Toolset_Integration}, so
 * requiring a file here as well would mean two places to edit and one to forget — and forgetting this
 * one is silent: the group still gets a tab, a count and a REST filter, and is simply unreachable over
 * MCP.
 *
 * So this subclass takes the declaration and answers from it. Adding an integration adds no file here.
 *
 * The base constructor only registers hooks — it calls none of the four abstract methods — so setting
 * the descriptor before `parent::__construct()` is safe.
 *

	 * default set is one that connected clients are quietly wrong about.
	 *
	 * They remain fully registered tools — still in the picker, still addable by
	 * hand, still callable. `toolset/integrations` also lists and runs every one
	 * of them, so a client whose cached list predates the plugin can still reach
	 * it.
	 *
	 * **The catch-all is the exception.** `other` is an integration in the
	 * mechanical sense — it is declared through the same registry
	 * ({@see AcrossAI_Toolset_Integrations::CATCH_ALL_GROUP}) — but it is present
	 * on every site and holds abilities belonging to no group. It is stable, so
	 * it stays a default. A blanket `false` here would drop it silently.
