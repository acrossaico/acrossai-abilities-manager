 * Feature 105 — registers the ability category used by all ACF abilities.

 * Guarded on ACF being installed so the category is not advertised on sites without it. The presence
 * probe goes through Acf_Guard so every ACF symbol in the suite is named in one directory.
 *
 * Runs on wp_abilities_api_categories_init — before the Library Processor calls
 * wp_register_ability(). WP core silently drops any ability whose category was not pre-registered
 * (BUG-WP-CORE-ABILITY-CATEGORY-PRE-REGISTRATION).
