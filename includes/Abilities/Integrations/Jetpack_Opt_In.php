/**
 * Jetpack's own abilities — the filter that makes them exist.
 *
 * Jetpack ships abilities from a shared package, `jetpack_vendor/automattic/jetpack-wp-abilities`,
 * which four of its feature packages call into: jetpack-stats, jetpack-forms, jetpack-backup and
 * jetpack-connection. Each calls `…_Abilities::init()` unconditionally during its own load, and the
 * gate sits inside the shared registrar (`src/class-registrar.php:91`):
 *
 *     if ( ! apply_filters( 'jetpack_wp_abilities_enabled', false ) ) {
 *         return;
 *     }
 *
 * Automattic's own comment explains the default:
 *
 * > Consumers opt in explicitly — per site, per user, or via feature flag — so abilities roll out
 * > gradually rather than flipping on for every site the moment the package loads.
 *
 * **Timing is the risk here.** Those packages read the filter while they load, not on a later hook,
 * so the filter has to be attached before Jetpack's own setup runs. `plugins_loaded` P20 — the base
 * class default, which suits ACF because ACF reads its setting at `acf/init` — is too late to be
 * safe, so {@see self::enable_hook()} moves it earlier. A switch that appears to work while doing
 * nothing is the failure mode this avoids.
 *
 * Four namespaces, not one: `jetpack-stats/*`, `jetpack-forms/*`, `jetpack-backup/*` and
 * `jetpack/get-connection-status`. There is no Jetpack toolset descriptor yet, so until one claims
 * those prefixes these land in **Other** — the intended failure per
 * DEC-TOOLSET-PREFIX-CLAIM-ONLY-WHAT-EXISTS, visible in the catch-all rather than mislabelled as
 * ours. Which also means this row does not yet gain a count from the toolset side; it appears
 * through its own Library definition below.
