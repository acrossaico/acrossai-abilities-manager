 * The set of toolset integrations known to this site.
 *
 * One place to ask "which integrations exist", consumed by the two things that need to agree: the
 * tagger, which assigns abilities to groups, and the bootstrap, which creates a dispatcher per group.
 * Those drifting apart is the failure this whole arrangement exists to prevent — a group with abilities
 * but no dispatcher gets a tab, a count and a REST filter while being unreachable over MCP, and nothing
 * reports it.
 *
 * Extend through the `acrossai_toolset_integrations` filter rather than by editing this file. A
 * companion plugin can then own its own integration entirely, which is Module Contract #4 and the
 * reason adding an integration is not a change here.
