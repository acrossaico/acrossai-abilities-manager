/**
 * Rank Math's toolset declaration.
 *
 * The mixed case, and the one that made issue #184 visible: this plugin declares 61 `rank-math/*`
 * abilities and Rank Math itself declares 27 more. Ours carry `meta.acrossai.tab_group` and always
 * grouped correctly; theirs carry nothing and grouped nowhere, so the Rank Math tab showed 61 of 87 and
 * an assistant reaching for `toolset-rank-math` could not see the other 26 at all.
 *
 * Declaring the `rank-math` prefix here closes that: both halves land in one group, and neither half
 * needs to know the other exists. The tagger never overwrites a declared group, so ours are untouched.
 *
 * Not an {@see AcrossAI_Integration_Ability_Base}: Rank Math does not gate its abilities behind a
 * setting, so there is no opt-in switch to own — only the grouping. That separation is why the two
 * contracts are distinct.
 *
 * @package    AcrossAI_Abilities_Manager
