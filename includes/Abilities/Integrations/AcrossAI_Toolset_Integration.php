/**
 * What one integration declares about its toolset.
 *
 * A toolset is derived, not registered: `AcrossAI_Ability_Group` builds the group map from whatever
 * `meta.acrossai.tab_group` values it finds on registered abilities. That works while this plugin
 * declares every ability, and stops working the moment the host plugin declares its own — those
 * abilities carry no `meta.acrossai`, so they belong to no group, appear in no tab, and are reachable
 * through no Toolset dispatcher (issue #184).
 *
 * This interface is the single declaration that closes the gap. From these five answers the plugin
 * derives: which abilities get tagged into the group, the admin tab and its count, the toolset filter,
 * the Toolset column, and the MCP dispatcher tool. Adding an integration means writing one of these —
 * no tagger edit, no `Toolset/` file, no bootstrap line.
 *
 * **It says nothing about who supplies the abilities**, which is what lets one mechanism cover all
 * three shapes an integration takes:
 *
 * - *Host plugin supplies everything* (ACF today). Nothing of ours registers; prefix tagging assigns
 *   the group.
 * - *Both supply some* (Rank Math today: 61 ours, 26 theirs). Ours already declare `tab_group` and are
 *   left alone; theirs are tagged. Both land in one group.
 * - *We supply everything* (Elementor today). Ours already declare `tab_group`; this declaration still
 *   owns the label, the description and the dispatcher.
 *
 * Tagging only ever fills a gap — an ability that already declares a group is never re-tagged — which
 * is what makes the mixed case work without either side knowing about the other.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from {@see AcrossAI_Integration_Ability_Base}. That class owns the *opt-in
 * switch*, which only applies when the host plugin gates its own abilities behind a setting. Grouping
 * and opt-in are different concerns: Rank Math needs grouping and no opt-in, ACF needs both. An
 * integration that needs both implements this interface *and* extends that base.
