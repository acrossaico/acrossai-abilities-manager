Two things to know before writing. Snippets are a custom post type, but writing that post type directly through the Content tools produces a snippet that never runs: WPCode keeps a separate cache option that its loader actually reads, and only its own save routine rebuilds it. And activating a php or universal snippet makes that code execute on this site, so those calls require confirm: true, are test-run by WPCode first, and report honestly when WPCode refuses. Run get-snippet-status first when a snippet appears to have no effect. Only present when WPCode is active. Requires administrator rights; note that WPCode grants its own wpcode_edit_snippets capability only to roles that already administer the site. action=discover lists this group; action=info returns schemas; action=execute runs one ability.',
