/**
 * Yoast SEO's toolset declaration.
 *
 * **The "both supply some" shape**, and the first suite in this plugin to both claim a host prefix
 * and add abilities of its own. Yoast registers five abilities under `yoast-seo/*`; this plugin adds
 * 62 more under `seo/*` and `taxonomies/*`. `ability_prefixes()` claims `yoast-seo` so Yoast's five
 * are tagged into the same group rather than falling into the Other catch-all, which is exactly the
 * gap issue #184 described — Yoast was simply never declared.
 *
 * Our own abilities must therefore never use a `yoast-seo/` slug: the prefix belongs to Yoast, and a
 * collision would shadow one of theirs. Test_Yoast_Suite_Contract asserts that.
 *
 * **A caveat about when those five actually appear.** Yoast gates its own abilities behind
 * `Should_Index_Indexables_Conditional`, which resolves to `is_production_mode()`, so on a staging or
 * local site it registers none of them and this group contains only ours. That is Yoast's decision,
 * not something this declaration can or should override — indexables store permalinks and building
 * them on staging bakes in the wrong ones. Our 62 are deliberately not gated the same way.
