/**
 * LiteSpeed Cache's toolset declaration.
 *
 * The "we supply everything" shape: LiteSpeed Cache registers no abilities of its own — verified
 * across v7.9.1, no `wp_register_ability` and no abilities-api reference anywhere — so every ability
 * in this group is one of ours, declared under `includes/Abilities/LiteSpeed/` and already carrying
 * `meta.acrossai.tab_group`. Nothing needs tagging, which is why `ability_prefixes()` is empty:
 * claiming the `litespeed` prefix would capture any ability LiteSpeed might add later and file it
 * under our label without anyone deciding to.
 *
 * This declaration still owns the group key, the display name and the MCP description, and it is what
 * generates the dispatcher — so there is no `includes/Abilities/Toolset/` file for this suite.
 *
 * @package    AcrossAI_Abilities_Manager
