 * Issue #202 — the opt-in that asks Yoast to register its own abilities off production.

 * Separate from {@see Yoast_Seo}, which declares the toolset and is constructed inside
 * `AcrossAI_Toolset_Integrations::built_in()`. That method runs behind a filter and may be called
 * more than once per request; this class hooks from its constructor, so folding the two together
 * would attach the enable filter and push the display rows twice — the hazard already documented on
 * ACF's absence from `built_in()`. One job each, constructed once from `Main::define_public_hooks()`.

 * This could not ship before #204. Yoast registers from `Loader::load_integrations()` on `init`,
 * later than the Library Processor's `wp_abilities_api_init` P5 — so while display-only rows were
 * still registered as real abilities, ours claimed the `yoast-seo/` names first and Yoast's real
 * registrations were refused as duplicates. Measured: five dead placeholders, and executing one
 * returned `Permission denied`. With the rows no longer registered, the names are free.
