/**
 * Contact Form 7's toolset declaration.
 *
 * The "we supply everything" shape: Contact Form 7 registers no abilities of its own — verified
 * across all 111 PHP files of v6.1.7 — so every ability in this group is one of ours, declared under
 * `includes/Abilities/ContactForm7/` and already carrying `meta.acrossai.tab_group`. Nothing needs
 * tagging, which is why `ability_prefixes()` is empty: claiming the `contact-form-7` prefix would
 * capture any ability CF7 might add later and file it under our label without anyone deciding to.
 *
 * This declaration still owns the group key, the display name and the MCP description, and it is what
 * generates the dispatcher — so there is no `includes/Abilities/Toolset/` file for this suite.
 *
 * @package    AcrossAI_Abilities_Manager
