/**
 * Elementor's own abilities — the switch that makes them exist.
 *
 * Elementor 4.x ships an MCP module at `elementor/modules/mcp/` declaring 27 abilities of its own,
 * and registers none of them until a site setting says so. `modules/mcp/module.php:151`:
 *
 *     add_action( 'wp_abilities_api_categories_init', [ $this, 'register_ability_category' ] );
 *
 *     if ( self::is_site_mcp_exposure_enabled() ) {
 *         add_action( 'wp_abilities_api_init', [ $this, 'register_abilities' ] );
 *     }
 *
 * Note the asymmetry: the category registers unconditionally while the abilities do not. That is why
 * a site can show `elementor` among the registered ability categories and still hold none of
 * Elementor's abilities — which reads as a bug in our grouping and is not one.
 *
 * The setting is the `elementor_mcp_enabled` option, read by
 * `Elementor\MCP\Composer\Admin\McpSettingsController::is_enabled()`, which returns false when the
 * option is absent. Its own docblock claims the opposite ("Missing or invalid values default to
 * enabled"); the code is authoritative, and the default is off. Elementor surfaces it at
 * Elementor → Elementor MCP (`page=elementor-mcp`).
 *
 * **That option gates two things, and we only want one of them.** It decides whether the abilities
 * register AND whether Elementor creates its MCP server at `/wp-json/elementor/mcp`
 * (`Server_Bootstrap::register_server()`). The abilities are already on the site and reaching them
 * is what this plugin is for. The server is site-wide MCP exposure, a feature Elementor ships off,
 * and switching it on is the site owner's call to make on Elementor's own screen — not a side
 * effect of installing this plugin.
 *
 * So this row does **not** touch the option. Until 0.0.43 it called
 * {@see AcrossAI_Integration_Ability_Base::force_option_true()} to short-circuit the read, which
 * got the abilities and the server together. Three things were wrong with that, and the first is
 * the one that matters: an option a host stores and surfaces in its own settings UI is the site
 * owner's saved answer, not an extension point. Overriding it left Elementor's screen showing a
 * switch nobody had set; it turned on site-wide exposure silently; and because our own transport
 * detector asks `Module::is_site_mcp_exposure_enabled()`, Quick Connect reported Elementor MCP
 * "active" on the strength of our own filter — a self-fulfilling answer.
 *
 * `Module::register_abilities()` is public, so the abilities can be registered directly with no
 * override at all. See {@see register_host_abilities()}.
 *
 * Note the asymmetry in Elementor's module that makes that possible: the `elementor` ability
 * CATEGORY is registered unconditionally while the abilities are not. It is also why a site can
 * list `elementor` among its ability categories and hold none of Elementor's abilities — which
 * reads as a bug in our grouping and is not one.
 *
 * Two of Elementor's 27 never register even with this on: `elementor/create-page` and
 * `elementor/update-page-settings` are names this plugin also declares, and we load first. See
 * issue #261 for that decision; it is not something this switch can fix.

	/**
	 * Register Elementor's own abilities, without switching on Elementor's MCP server.
	 *
	 * Elementor gates two separate things behind one option. Its 27 abilities register at
	 * `modules/mcp/module.php:152`, and its MCP server at `/wp-json/elementor/mcp` is created in
	 * `Server_Bootstrap::register_server()` — both on `elementor_mcp_enabled`. We want the
	 * abilities and not the server: the abilities are already on the site and reaching them is what
	 * this plugin is for, while the server is site-wide exposure the owner should switch on
	 * themselves at Elementor → Elementor MCP.
	 *
	 * Until 0.0.43 this called `force_option_true( self::HOST_OPTION )`, which got both. See the
	 * class docblock for why overriding that particular option was the wrong instrument.
	 *
	 * **Priority 15, and it is pinned between two things.**
	 *
	 * Later than our own abilities, which register at 5 (Library processor) and 10 (absorbed
	 * definitions, {@see \AcrossAI_Abilities_Manager\Includes\Main}). Two slugs collide —
	 * `elementor/create-page` and `elementor/update-page-settings` are names we also declare — and
	 * today OURS win because whoever registers first keeps the name. Registering Elementor's set
	 * any earlier silently flips that and changes what those two abilities do: a behaviour change
	 * disguised as a refactor. Issue #261 is about whether that answer is right; this only
	 * preserves it.
	 *
	 * Earlier than the Toolsets at 20, and this half is easy to get wrong. A Toolset's `register()`
	 * calls `has_any_member()`, which resolves group membership through
	 * `AcrossAI_Ability_Group::members()` — and that **memoises the whole grouping for the rest of
	 * the request**. Registering after 20 therefore puts the abilities in the registry while every
	 * Toolset keeps working from a grouping taken before they arrived. Measured at priority 30:
	 * `wp_get_abilities()` held all 27, and `toolset/integrations` with `plugin=elementor` returned
	 * 81 of 106 with only the two colliding slugs — a silent, total miss for anything reached
	 * through a Toolset, which is how this plugin is used.
	 *
	 * The flush below makes that ordering explicit rather than load-bearing, so a future priority
	 * change degrades into a wasted rebuild instead of a silent miss.
