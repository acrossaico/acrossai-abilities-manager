/**
 * The toolset of last resort.
 *
 * Every registered ability should belong to a toolset, so that the tab counts sum to the total and no
 * ability is reachable only by scrolling "All". Curated groups cannot guarantee that on their own: a
 * plugin this codebase has never heard of can register an ability at any time, and before this existed
 * such an ability silently belonged nowhere and was invisible to every MCP dispatcher (issue #184).
 *
 * It claims no prefixes. Nothing is *assigned* here — abilities arrive because
 * {@see AcrossAI_Ability_Group_Tagger} found no better home, which is why its description promises the
 * caller nothing about the contents.
 *
 * On a site where every active plugin is mapped this group is empty, and `Base_Toolset_Ability`
 * declines to register a dispatcher for an empty group — so it costs nothing until it is needed.
