/**
 * The integration catalogue, fetched from acrossai.co.
 *
 * The Integrations screen answers two different questions about the same list, and only one of them
 * can be answered locally. "Is this integration on, and how many abilities does it contribute?" is
 * site state, and `AcrossAI_Integration_Settings` already knows it. "What is this integration, what
 * category is it, is it free or Pro, where do I read about it?" is catalogue copy that changes when
 * an integration is written — which happens between plugin releases, so a hardcoded array here
 * would be stale the week after it shipped.
 *
 * So the catalogue is fetched. That makes this the plugin's first outbound HTTP request from PHP,
 * and the rules it is held to are correspondingly narrow:
 *
 * - It runs only when an administrator opens the screen. Never on a front-end request, never on
 *   cron, never on activation, and never for a user who could not see the result anyway.
 * - It sends nothing. No query arguments, no headers, no body — the request carries no site URL, no
 *   licence key, no user identity, nothing that distinguishes this site from any other. The reply
 *   is the same bytes for everybody, which is what makes it cacheable and what makes the
 *   "External services" disclosure in readme.txt short.
 * - It never blocks the screen. A failure is normal operation, not an error state: a copy of the
 *   catalogue ships in the plugin and renders instead, flagged stale so the UI can say so quietly.
 * - It trusts nothing it reads. `normalise()` is a whitelist, not a filter — every field is coerced
 *   to an expected scalar, length-capped, and dropped if it cannot be made safe. Anything not named
 *   in the schema is discarded rather than passed through. A compromised or simply changed endpoint
 *   can make this screen wrong, but it cannot make it dangerous.
 *
 * The join itself is not done here. This class answers only "what does the catalogue say", and the
 * REST controller merges that onto local truth — which means a catalogue entry can never invent an
 * integration the site does not have, nor claim one is enabled when it is not.
