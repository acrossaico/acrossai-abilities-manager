/**
 * One-time migration: `acrossai-abilities-manager-*` category slugs → `acrossai-*`.
 *
 * The ability category slug is not merely a label. It is:
 *   1. the key of the `acrossai_library_config` site option, and
 *   2. the value stored in `{prefix}acrossai_abilities.category` for every
 *      DB-defined ability an operator created through the Abilities screen.
 *
 * Renaming the registered categories without touching those two stores would
 * be silently destructive. WordPress refuses to register an ability whose
 * category is not registered — `WP_Abilities_Registry::register()` calls
 * `_doing_it_wrong()` and returns null — so every operator-created ability
 * still pointing at an old slug would simply stop existing, visible only
 * under WP_DEBUG. The saved Integrations toggles would meanwhile revert to
 * their defaults, which for third-party integration cards means OFF.
 *
 * Both rewrites are plain string replacements and safe to repeat, but the
 * completion flag keeps them off the hot path once done.
 *
