/**
 * Abstract base class for third-party plugin integrations on the Ability Library page.
 *
 * Feature 060. A concrete subclass represents one third-party WordPress plugin
 * whose WP Abilities API abilities are gated behind a plugin-specific filter
 * (e.g. Advanced Custom Fields requires add_filter('acf/settings/enable_acf_ai',
 * '__return_true') before it registers its FieldGroup / PostType / Taxonomy
 * abilities).
 *
 * ## Contract (all abstract)
 *
 *   - slug()              — key used as BOTH category AND tab_group
 *   - label()             — display label for the card / tab
 *   - is_plugin_active()  — the plugin-existence gate; called per-request
 *   - enable_filter()     — subclass attaches its add_filter(...) here
 *   - abilities()         — fixed readonly list rendered inside the card
 *
 * The constructor wires two hooks:
 *   - plugins_loaded @ P20        → maybe_enable()
 *   - acrossai_abilities_api_init → push_definition()
 *
 * Both callbacks call is_plugin_active() first and return early when false, so
 * a deactivated third-party plugin never surfaces a card, a tab, or a filter
 * attachment on the current request. Because the check runs per-request rather
 * than being cached at construction, activating or deactivating the target
 * plugin takes effect on the very next page load.
 *
 * ## How to add a new integration (subclass)
 *
 *   1. Create a new class under `includes/Abilities/Integrations/` extending
 *      this base class. Add a `public const TAB_GROUP` for other plugins to
 *      reference (see includes/Abilities/Integrations/ACF.php as the canonical
 *      example).
 *   2. Implement the five abstract methods.
 *   3. Instantiate the class once from `includes/Main.php::define_public_hooks()`
 *      near the ACF instantiation. Instantiation must happen BEFORE
 *      plugins_loaded @ P20 fires — instantiating from define_public_hooks
 *      (which runs at Main construction time, i.e. plugins_loaded @ P0) is
 *      correct.
 *   4. There is intentionally no auto-discovery of integrations — each new
 *      integration is one hardcoded line in Main.php. This keeps the tab bar
 *      auditable and predictable.
 *
 * ## How third-party plugins add custom cards to an integration tab
 *
 * A separate WordPress plugin (e.g. "acrossai-acf-extras") can add its own
 * ability cards next to an integration's toggle card on the same tab. This is
 * how the tab becomes an extensibility surface, not just a single-card view.
 *
 * The pattern requires THREE things, all of them:
 *
 *   1. **Register the ability CATEGORY** on `wp_abilities_api_categories_init`.
 *      WP core (WP_Abilities_Registry::register() in
 *      wp-includes/abilities-api/class-wp-abilities-registry.php lines 132-146)
 *      REJECTS any ability whose category slug is not pre-registered. Skip
 *      this step and your abilities are silently dropped by
 *      wp_register_ability() — the Library UI card WILL still render (it
 *      reads from our Registry, not from wp_get_abilities()), but the ability
 *      will NEVER appear in the Custom Abilities table or MCP
 *      `discover-abilities`. This has bitten us before; the requirement is
 *      strict.
 *   2. Extend `AcrossAI_Abilities_Manager\Includes\Modules\Library\Ability_Definition`
 *      and implement `ability()` returning the ability spec.
 *   3. Set `meta.acrossai.tab_group` on the ability's args to the integration's
 *      published `TAB_GROUP` constant (e.g. `ACF::TAB_GROUP`) so the card
 *      routes onto the integration's tab.
 *
 * Complete working example (in a third-party plugin's mu-plugin or main file):
 *
 *     use AcrossAI_Abilities_Manager\Includes\Abilities\Integrations\ACF;
 *     use AcrossAI_Abilities_Manager\Includes\Modules\Library\Ability_Definition;
 *
 *     // Step 1 — REQUIRED — register the category BEFORE wp_register_ability runs.
 *     add_action( 'wp_abilities_api_categories_init', static function () {
 *         wp_register_ability_category( 'my-plugin-acf', array(
 *             'label'       => __( 'My ACF Add-on', 'my-plugin' ),
 *             'description' => __( 'Adds custom ACF helper abilities.', 'my-plugin' ),
 *         ) );
 *     } );
 *
 *     // Steps 2 + 3 — extend Ability_Definition and target the ACF tab.
 *     class My_ACF_Addon_Ability extends Ability_Definition {
 *         protected function ability(): array {
 *             return array(
 *                 'name' => 'my-plugin/my-acf-helper',
 *                 'args' => array(
 *                     'label'               => __( 'My ACF Helper', 'my-plugin' ),
 *                     'description'         => __( 'Does something with ACF.', 'my-plugin' ),
 *                     'category'            => 'my-plugin-acf',   // matches the registered category slug
 *                     'execute_callback'    => array( $this, 'execute' ),
 *                     'permission_callback' => static function () {
 *                         return current_user_can( 'manage_options' );
 *                     },
 *                     'meta' => array(
 *                         'acrossai' => array(
 *                             'tab_group' => ACF::TAB_GROUP,   // routes onto the "Acf" tab
 *                         ),
 *                     ),
 *                 ),
 *             );
 *         }
 *         public function execute( array $input = array() ) { return array( 'ok' => true ); }
 *     }
 *
 *     add_action( 'plugins_loaded', static function () {
 *         if ( ! class_exists( ACF::class ) ) { return; }
 *         new My_ACF_Addon_Ability();
 *     }, 25 );
 *
 * The add-on's card renders as a REGULAR library card (toggle + expand + All/
 * Specific radio + per-ability checkboxes), styled like the "Core" cards on
 * other tabs, and shows up ALONGSIDE the integration's read-only toggle card.
 *
 * Use a DISTINCT category slug per third-party plugin (e.g. `'my-plugin-acf'`)
 * so it renders as its own card. Reusing the integration's own slug
 * (`'acf'`) would fail-register (category not pre-registered from the
 * third-party's side) AND would attempt to merge the add-on abilities into the
 * integration card, which is not intended.
 *
 * A worked demo mu-plugin exercising this pattern with two categories +
 * three abilities is captured in Feature 060's quickstart doc:
 * `specs/060-library-third-party-integration-toggles/quickstart.md`.
 *
 * ## Boot Flow Rule deviation
 *
 * This class registers hooks in its constructor rather than being wired via
 * Main.php's Loader. This mirrors the existing
 * AcrossAI_Abilities_Manager\Includes\Modules\Library\Ability_Definition
 * pattern (~176 concrete subclasses). See DEC-ABILITY-DEFINITION-CTOR-HOOKS
 * (Feature 060) — accepted deviation sibling to DEC-EXTERNAL-PACKAGE-HOOK-CTOR.

	/**
	 * Callback for the acrossai_abilities_api_init filter.
	 *
	 * When the target plugin is active, appends one synthetic definition row
	 * per subclass-declared ability — all sharing the same category, tab_group,
	 * and card_variant='integration'. The Library page's groupDefinitions()
	 * helper folds them into a single card automatically. When the target
	 * plugin is missing, returns $definitions unchanged (no tab, no card, no
	 * dereference of target-plugin symbols anywhere in this class).
	 *
	 * Each synthetic row includes a fail-closed execute_callback that returns
	 * WP_Error if it is somehow invoked. These rows are display-only; the
	 * target plugin is responsible for actually registering the abilities via
	 * its own wp_abilities_api_init path.
	 *
	 * ## Design contract — synthetic rows intentionally fail wp_register_ability()
	 *
	 * Every synthetic row emitted by this method carries the integration slug
	 * as its `category` (e.g. `'acf'`). That slug is intentionally NEVER
	 * registered as a WP ability category via `wp_register_ability_category()`
	 * on `wp_abilities_api_categories_init`. WP core (see
	 * `wp-includes/abilities-api/class-wp-abilities-registry.php` lines
	 * 132-146) silently rejects any ability whose category is not
	 * pre-registered, so `wp_register_ability()` returns null and the
	 * synthetic rows never enter `wp_get_abilities()`. This is the desired
	 * behavior: the rows exist SOLELY to drive the Library UI card (which
	 * reads from our Registry, not from wp_get_abilities()), and their
	 * `execute_callback`/`permission_callback` are fail-closed as
	 * defence-in-depth in case that WP-core rule ever changes.
	 *
	 * **Do NOT register the integration slug as an ability category.** Doing
	 * so would cause every synthetic row's fail-closed callbacks to
	 * successfully register into WP core, leaking N broken abilities per
	 * integration into `wp_get_abilities()`, MCP `discover-abilities`, and
	 * the Custom Abilities admin table. If a future integration needs its
	 * synthetic rows to appear in wp_get_abilities(), replace the fail-closed
	 * callbacks with real implementations FIRST, then register the category.
	 *
	 * (This design intent is verified in production: the ACF integration's
	 * synthetic `acf/*` rows are absent from wp_get_abilities() even when
	 * the toggle is on — only the target plugin's real abilities register.)
